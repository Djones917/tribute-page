          <ul>
            <li><strong>August 13, 1899</strong> – Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, the second son and the youngest of three of William Hitchcock and Emma Hitchcock, was born in Leytonstone, London. This is the birth of a genius. An innovator of cinema. The man who
              defined the thriller genre. Welcome to the world, Alfred Hitchcock.</li>

            <li><strong>1920</strong> – Received a full-time job at Islington Studios, and its British successor, Gainsborough, designing titles for silent movies. This was Hitchcock’s first shot in the film industry. His humble origins as a title designer
              contrasts greatly with his future job as a full-time director.</li>


            <li><strong>1925</strong> – Michael Balcon of Gainsborough Pictures gave Hitchcock a chance to direct his first film The Pleasure Garden (based on a novel by Oliver Sandys) made at UFA studios in Germany. Starring Virginia Malli and Carmelita
              Geraghty, it was commercial failure and endangered his future as a film director. Hitchcock’s first movie to direct was a failure, and people were not sure of this man’s future as a film director, but his later movies were instant classics.</li>

            <li><strong>1926</strong> – Hitchcock made his debut in the thriller genre, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (released in January 1927 in the UK). This film was a commercial and critical success, and was the first true “Hitchcockian” film
              that incorporated many themes he would use in his later films. This film can be considered Hitchcock’s first “true” film as this film was more like his later ones. Many consider this the “start” of his career.</li>

            <li><strong>June 30, 1929</strong> – Blackmail was released as the first all-talkie movie (motion picture with sound), starring Anny Ondra, John Longden, and Cyril Ritchard. It was first meant to be a silent movie, but producers later decided to make it with sound.
              The climax of the film was taken on the dome of the British Museum, and started Hitchcock’s tradition of making use of landmarks for suspense scenes in his movies. Hitchcock’s Blackmail had many “firsts” and was a precedent to many of his
              critically-acclaimed films.</li>

            <li><strong>1934</strong> – The Man Who Knew Too Much was released, and was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed motion pictures of Hitchcock’s British period. It starred Leslie Banks, Edna Best, and Peter Lorre. This was the only film remade by
              Hitchcock, for Paramount Pictures in 1956. When this film was remade, critics said it lacked the magic of the original. I guess one cannot repeat a masterpiece.</li>

            <li><strong>March 1939</strong> – Hollywood producer David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock, who moved to the United States, to a seven year contract. Selznick had frequent money problems and often controlled the creativity Alfred had over his films. Hitchcock moved
              to Santa Cruz, CA and begun his reign over Hollywood. Selznick and Hitchcock worked together for many movies until Hitchcock’s contract ended. From then on, Hitchcock produced his own films.</li>
            
            <li><strong>April 22, 1942</strong> – The first of two films made for Universal Studios, Saboteur, starring Priscilla Lane, Robert Cummings, and Norman Lloyd, releases.  Hitchcock did extensive location shooting, especially atop the Statue of Liberty, a first in Hollywood.  Hitchcock set the precedent of using famous landmarks in films. He repeatedly did this in his movies.</li>
              
              <li><strong>August 15, 1946</strong> – Notorious was released and has remained one of Hitchcock’s most acclaimed films.  Featuring a plot about Nazis, South America, and uranium, the movie starred Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman.  Because he used uranium as a plot device, Hitchcock was under brief FBI surveillance.  Dr. Robert Millikan of Caltech was apparently contacted by Hitchcock about the development of the atomic bomb.  This film shows that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time, as he incorporated a story that we might see in action movies these days.</li>
            
            <li><strong>May 29, 1954</strong> – Hitchcock returns to Technicolor with his film Dial M for Murder.  Hitchcock tried experimenting with 3D for this movie, but it didn’t make the final cuts.  Dial M or Murder starred Ray Milland and Grace Kelly.  Hitchcock kept switching from Technicolor films to black and white ones, firstly because of budget reasons, and secondly to create a mood to fit the story of the movie.</li>
            
            <li><strong>August 1, 1954</strong> – The critically acclaimed Rear Window releases and is considered one of Hitchcock’s most thrilling and most exciting pictures.  It spawned many remakes and retellings.  In 1997, this movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.  A remake of the same name, starring Christopher Reeve (after his accident) was released in 1998.  Disturbia, a 2007 thriller movie with the same premise as Rear Window met with critical success as a “Hitchcockian” film.  Both were well received, but could not match the genius of Alfred Hitchcock.</li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>May 9, 1958</strong> – Vertigo, a film that was a box office failure met with negative reviews, was released.  However, today the film is seen as a classic Hitchcock movie.  It starred James Stewart.  People did not like thriller/romance movies, but a careful watch of this movie could have changed their minds.</li>
            
            <li><strong>June 16, 1960</strong> – Psycho was released, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin.  It is often mentioned as Hitchcock’s most well-known film, even when it was taken in black and white on a spare camera set.  The shower scene spawned many parodies and became a legacy.  Psycho is the film the average person will know if asked about a Hitchcock film.  A 1998 remake was a box office failure, even when it copied the original frame-by-frame.     
</li>
            
            <li><strong>April 29, 1980</strong> – At age 81, Alfred Hitchcock died of arthritis, liver failure, and slowdown of kidney function.   On this day, the world lost the father of thriller films and the innovator of cinema.  Never again will another director take control of the movie industry like Alfred Hitchcock.  </li>
